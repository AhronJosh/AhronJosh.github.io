    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hi my name is Ahron Josh F. Pesimo, I am 17 born May 22 2004, 
      My hobbies are playing video games,reading manga,watching anime,and watching movies.
      I live in San Antonio Valley 1 Paranaque City.
      I graduated from Paranaque National High School.
      I'm a shy person but friendly.
    </p>


     <h2>Why did you enroll as an ICT student? Why not other track or strands?</h2>
     <p>
       Because this course is the path to achieve my dream job and if
       i choose a different course that is not about computer or coding if
       i graduate i will not achieve my dream job and if i still want to learn
       about computer or coding i will need more time and effort doing research
       and learning it all on my own.
     </p>


     <h2>What is your dream job? How do you think will this course will help you in pursuing your career?</h2>
     <p>
       My dream job is BSIT or IT. This course will help me achieve my dream
       job because it's more or less all about computers and coding. This will be
       the start of me being dedicated and pursuing my career because my interest
       is on computers,coding,and creating games.
     </p>


     <h2>To whom are you dedicating your success in finishing course? Yourself, family, friends, special someone etc. Why?</h2>
     <p>
       For myself because this course was picked by me so it is more dedicated
       to myself because I want to learn more about computers,coding,creating games
       and this course is the path that will help me achieve my dream job but still
       finishing school will make my family at ease.
     </p>
